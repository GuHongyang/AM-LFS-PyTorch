# AM-LFS-PyTorch
The reproduce for "AM-LFS: AutoML for Loss Function Search"

Currently trying to reproduce this article. But now it can only reach 91.6%, which is still far from the 93.08% in the article.

Note that you must use pytorch 1.3 version, otherwise it will cause a large amount of GPU occupancy when the processes exchange models.
